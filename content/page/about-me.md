Hi and welcome to my website! I have created it mostly for my own benefit, to help me with:
* investigating and understanding technical issues
* remembering what I have learned
* practicing writing technical documentation

In addition, I'd be really happy if anything I write here is useful to anyone else, and I'd love to hear from you if that is the case.  I'd also welcome any contributions, advice and tips on these topics.

I've been working in IT since late 2014.  I started in a typical helpdesk role, in a predominantly Windows environment.  I soon took on responsibility for managing Macs as well, and then progressed into Systems Engineering roles.  These days, my focus is on managing MDM (especially Jamf Pro) and SaaS applications such as Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Okta, Slack, AWS, the Atlassian suite, and others.  I particularly enjoy working to automate processes using tools such as Okta workflows, and scripting with shell script, python, or Powershell.

I have lots of opinions on the tech I work with, some of which are well thought out and based on my experience.  All of them are open to change, if the circumstances warrant it.  Any opinions expressed on this site are solely my own, and in no way reflect the position of any past, present, or future employer.

## Personal
I'm based in Romford, on the eastern edge of London, in the UK.  

I've been a Christian since 2000, and married to my wife Rosie since 2003.  We have three kids.
